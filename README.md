# ADBackup
Backup your rooted Android phone using ADB.
## Why?
NANDroid backups by TWRP are effectively dead. TWRP isn't supported on any modern devices (goes up to Pixel 5 only).  
  
This project answers the question: why do we not have any NANDroid backup solutions anymore?
## Usage
You need:
1. Python 3.9 or greater
2. ADB installed globally
3. ADB drivers for your phone
4. Phone with root access
